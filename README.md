### Project requirements
- This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI

- When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts

- If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files

- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance

- The HTML code should use sematic tags

- The game should have a Readme.md file in the Github repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
